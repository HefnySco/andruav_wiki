Andruav GCS App
===============


Andruav App works in two modes. **Drone mode** which is used to connect to drone and control it as a companion computer. And **GCS mode** that works as a ground control station.
These modes are switchables from the button highlighted in the below image.

The above image shows a typical scenario where the user opens **MAP** screen to monitor drones, a drone list is available. A user needs to select a drone -as multiple drones could exist-. 
If the drone disconnected from FCB a user can press **CTRL** button to reconnect drome mobile to FCB board.



**FCB Button** is a telemetry for other GCS apps. Please refer to :ref:`andruav-gcs-telemetry`.
