Andruav FPV is very distinguished, as it allows multiple GCS to receive a video broadcast from the same vehicle. Those GCSs could be in different places in the world and they all share the same video streaming from drone. Also video streaming receiving is supported by Andruav GCS mobile app, as well as :ref:`andruav-web-client`.

Although the video shows devices in one place, but you can make the same scenario using devices in different locations, even different continents. 
The streaming protocol handles network bandwidth intelligently and adapt video quality according to bandwidth availability, also processing power of the receiving device determine video smoothing and glitches.
